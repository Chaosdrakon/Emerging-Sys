# Emerging-Sys
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The first project that I submitted was making the LED blink in a set pattern that goes through a constant loop woth no outside affects no matter which buttons that are pressed. The second project is creating a thermostat that has a set point and it can be changed with differnt buttons. On the second project it also needs to be able to read the current tempature of the room.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel for both of these projects that the area I reallt excelled in was making nice clean code that was mistake free. The code that was written in both projects has great spacing and is indented nicely thoughout the entire projects.

Where could you improve?
Althought the code that is written is very nice and error free it does however suffer from lack of comments. Not having comments causes issues when I need to make changes or someone else neeeds to review it.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
A great tool that I am adding to my support network is the code composer as a whole. This may not seem like a huge support system but with the ability to see different prebuilt projects it allows me to understand how different things already work and how I can make it my own and improve on it.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The ability to decode my code and write effeicent code is something that was great to learn but ties directly into my degree and will be helpful in all my coding classes.
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Well written code was the superstar of these projects and is what makes the so readable and adaptable to other projects if need be.
